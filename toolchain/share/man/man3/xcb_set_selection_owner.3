.IP \fIconn\fP 1i
The XCB connection to X11.

The selection will not be changed if \fItime\fP is earlier than the current
last-change time of the \fIselection\fP or is later than the current X server time.
Otherwise, the last-change time is set to the specified time.

The special value \fIXCB_CURRENT_TIME\fP will be replaced with the current server
time.
