.TH TS_CLOSE_RESTRICTED 3  "" "" "tslib"
.SH NAME
ts_close_restricted \- use a custom function for closing the touchscreen's
input device file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <tslib.h>
.sp
.BI "void (*ts_close_restricted)(int fd, void *user_data);
.sp
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR ts_close_restricted ()
is useful if libts should not be run as root. If such a function is implemented
by the user and assigned to the ts_close_restricted pointer, it will be called
by ts_close() instead of the close() system call directly.

It should obviously close the device with file descriptor
.BR fd
while
.BR user_data
is currently unused.

.BR ts_open_restricted (3),
.BR ts_open (3),
.BR ts_setup (3),
.BR ts_close (3),
