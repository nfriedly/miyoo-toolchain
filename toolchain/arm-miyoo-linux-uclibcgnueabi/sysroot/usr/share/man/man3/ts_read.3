.TH TS_READ 3  "" "" "tslib"
.SH NAME
ts_read, ts_read_raw, ts_read_mt, ts_read_raw_mt \- read tslib touch samples
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <tslib.h>
.sp
.BI "int ts_read(struct tsdev *" dev ", struct ts_sample *" samp ", int " nr ");"
.sp
.BI "int ts_read_raw(struct tsdev *" dev ", struct ts_sample *" samp ", int " nr ");"
.sp
.BI "int ts_read_mt(struct tsdev *" dev ", struct ts_sample_mt **" samp ", int " slots ", int " nr ");"
.sp
.BI "int ts_read_raw_mt(struct tsdev *" dev ", struct ts_sample_mt **" samp ", int " slots ", int " nr ");"
.sp

.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR ts_read ()
reads
.BR nr
input samples with tslib's filters applied.
.BI "struct ts_sample"
is define as follows:
.nf
struct ts_sample {
        int             x;
        int             y;
        unsigned int    pressure;
        struct timeval  tv;
};
.fi
.PP

.BR ts_read_mt()
reads
.BR nr
*
.BR slots
input samples with tslib's filters applied.
.BI "struct ts_sample_mt"
is defined as follows:
.nf
struct ts_sample_mt {
        /* most recent ABS_MT_* event codes.
         * see linux/input.h for descriptions */
        int             x;
        int             y;
        unsigned int    pressure;
        int             slot;
        int             tracking_id;

        int             tool_type;
        int             tool_x;
        int             tool_y;
        unsigned int    touch_major;
        unsigned int    width_major;
        unsigned int    touch_minor;
        unsigned int    width_minor;
        int             orientation;
        int             distance;
        int             blob_id;

        struct timeval  tv;

        /* BTN_TOUCH state */
        short           pen_down;

        /* the TSLIB_MT_VALID bit is set in valid if this sample
         * contains new data;
	 * valid is set to 0 otherwise */
        short           valid;
};
.fi
.PP
The user has to provide the amount of memory described in
.BR nr
and
.BR slots
to hold them.

.BR ts_read_raw ()
and
.BR ts_read_raw_mt ()
do the same thing without tslib's filters applied.

.SH RETURN VALUE
The number of actually read samples is returned. Especially when opened in non-blocking mode, see
.BR ts_setup()
, that can be less than requested in the call. On failure, a negative error number is returned.

.SH EXAMPLE
The following program continuously reads tslib multitouch input samples
and prints slot and position values to stdout as the touch screen is
touched.
