# WIP legacy uClibc Miyoo Toolchain Docker
Dockerfile to build an image with the toolchain and other dependencies necessary to build software for [Miyoo Custom Firmware (CFW)](https://github.com/TriForceX/MiyooCFW) using the older uClibc toolchain

See https://github.com/TriForceX/MiyooCFW/wiki/Build-Source for more info.

Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/r/nfriedly/miyoo-toolchain

see also the `steward` branch.

`legacy/legacy.Dockerfile` uses the toolchain from the [wiki](https://github.com/TriForceX/MiyooCFW/wiki/Build-Source), but may be missing some other dependencies. It is not currently published on dockerhub.
