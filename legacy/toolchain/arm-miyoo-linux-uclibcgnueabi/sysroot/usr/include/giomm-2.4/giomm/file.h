/** File and directory handling.
 * Gio::File is a high level abstraction for manipulating files on a virtual file system. Gio::Files are lightweight, immutable objects that do no
 * I/O upon creation. It is necessary to understand that a Gio::File object does not represent a file, merely a handle to a file. All file I/O is
 * implemented as streaming operations (see Gio::InputStream and Gio::OutputStream).
 *
 * A GioFile can be constructed from a path, URI, or a command line argument.
 *
 * You can move through the filesystem with Gio::File handles with get_parent() to get a handle to the parent directory,
 * get_child() to get a handle to a child within a directory, and resolve_relative_path() to resolve a relative path between two Gio::Files.
 *
 * Many Gio::File operations have both synchronous and asynchronous versions to suit your application. Asynchronous versions of synchronous
 * functions simply have _async() appended to their function names. The asynchronous I/O functions call a SlotAsyncReady callback slot which is
 * then used to finalize the operation, producing a AsyncResult which is then passed to the function's matching _finish() operation.
 *
 * Some Gio::File operations do not have synchronous analogs, as they may take a very long time to finish, and blocking may leave an application
 * unusable. Notable cases include: mount_mountable() to mount a mountable file, unmount_mountable() to unmount a mountable file,
 * and eject_mountable() to eject a mountable file.
 *
 * One notable feature of Gio::Files are entity tags, or "etags" for short. Entity tags are somewhat like a more abstract version of the
 * traditional mtime, and can be used to quickly determine if the file has been modified from the version on the file system.
 * See the HTTP 1.1 specification for HTTP Etag headers, which are a very similar concept.

 /** This slot type is used by measure_disk_usage() to make
  * periodic progress reports when measuring the amount of disk spaced

  *
  * These calls are made on a best-effort basis and not all types of
  * GFile will support them.  At the minimum, however, one call will
  * always be made immediately.
  *
  * In the case that there is no support, @a reporting will be set to
  * false (and the other values undefined) and no further calls will be
  * made.  Otherwise, the @a reporting will be true and the other values
  * all-zeros during the first (immediate) call.  In this way, you can
  * know which type of progress UI to show without a delay.
  *
  * For measure_disk_usage() the callback is made directly.  For
  * measure_disk_usage_async() the callback is made via the
  * default main context of the calling thread (ie: the same way that the
  * final async result would be reported).
  *
  * @a current_size is in the same units as requested by the operation (see
  * FILE_DISK_USAGE_APPARENT_SIZE).
  *
  * The frequency of the updates is implementation defined, but is
  * ideally about once every 200ms.
  *
  * The last progress callback may or may not be equal to the final
  * result.  Always check the async result to get the final value.
  *
  * For instance,
  * void on_file_measure_progress(bool reporting, guint64 current_size, guint64 num_dirs, guint64 num_files);
  *
