.SH DESCRIPTION
Makes the specified window a child of the specified parent window. If the
window is mapped, it will automatically be unmapped before reparenting and
re-mapped after reparenting. The window is placed in the stacking order on top
with respect to sibling windows.

After reparenting, a ReparentNotify event is generated.

If you want to handle errors directly with \fIxcb_request_check\fP instead, use \fIxcb_reparent_window_checked\fP. See \fBxcb-requests(3)\fP for details.
